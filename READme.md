## Welcome to my Portfolio Website as part of the She Codes Plus program!
It has been an adventure indeed. 

The following items have been covered as part of this project:
* Github & Github Desktop basics
  * Create a repository
  * Committing to the local repository, and the pushing to Github
  * Deploy to personal pages
* HTML
  * Semantic elements, tags (well, I have tried)
  * Best practices: indentation, naming conventions 
* CSS
  * Order of importance
  * Class vs. id
  * Typography
  * Flex box!
  * Color: hexadecimal, rgb and named
  * Media Queries for Responsive Design

Although I didn't do the extra-brownie points which was to include javascript, I did embed a youtube video of my screen-recording of completing this project, and I created it in to a time lapse (which is pretty neat).
